# DeepRL-Mountain-car
Deep Q learning model for solving Open AI Gym control task: Mountain car

Briefly about content:
* Trained model with DQN algorithm for Mountain car problem
* Used Experience Replay, Reward Shaping and Auxiliary loss techniques
* Tested different setups (Model's arhitecture, Reward function, Loss function) to find best one
* At the very end applied idea of ensemble learning to make results even better
